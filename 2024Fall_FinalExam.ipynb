    "}\n",

    "In the **purchase dictionary**, each key is a product barcode. The value for each key is a dictionary that contains the quantity of the product that the customer purchased, and the price per item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers can use discount coupons when they buy items at your store. Typically, a customer hands the cashier several coupons. All of the coupons cannot necessarily be used, however -- each coupon specifies which product it applies to, a quantity of that product that the customer must purchase to receive the discount, and the discount that the customer will receive. If a customer doesn't buy a coupon's product, or if they don't buy enough of the product, the coupon will not apply. You decide to represent all of a customer's coupons with a **coupon dictionary** of this form:\n",

The 123456 coupon can be used if the customer buys 4 or more of that product; the discount will be 25% (.25). Similarly, the 443002 coupon can be used if the customer buys 6 or more of that product; the discount will be .33.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the **purchase dictionary** and **coupon dictionary** above, we see the following:\n",
    "* The coupon for product 123456 can be used -- the customer bought 4 of those, which is enough to get the discount. The initial total for these items would be $4 x \\$1.00 = \\$4.00$, but after subtracting a 25% discount, the total comes to \\\\$3.00.\n",
    "* The coupon for product 443002 cannot be used -- the customer only bought 5 of those, and the coupon requires 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `coupon` that requires two parameters, a **purchase dictionary** and a **coupon dictionary**. The first argument tells us what the customer purchased, and the second argument tells us which coupons the customer hopes to use. Your function should calculate the customer's total amount spent, subtract any discounts due to coupons that can be used, and return this amount as a float.\n",
